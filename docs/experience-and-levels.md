# Experience

We are playing using experience. The XP characters earn will be posted in the session issue after each session is completed. XP should be granted for all encounters that are overcome, regardless of how. Talking an ogre out of a fight worth just as much xp as defeating them in combat or sneaking through their camp (provided that it's not resolved by a single roll and there is some action/drama).

# Levels

Leveling up occurs after you have enough xp and take a long rest. This will almost always happen after a session, but if you get enough xp and the adventures continues into another session where there is not a long rest you won't level until you can rest or the adventure completes and a rest is assumed.
