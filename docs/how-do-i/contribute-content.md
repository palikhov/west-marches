# Contributing Lore and Setting Information

The town of Waldenstone is a growing, thriving community with many mysteries to be discovered. We welcome input from everyone! If you have an idea we'd love to hear it. Everyone is welcome to write up some lore to create suggestions of lore that they'd love to see, but haven't written. 

### Contributing Lore

To add some lore create a Pull Request creating and/or updating files in [the setting folder](../../setting/). One of the `Lore Keepers` will review and approve the Pull Request to ensure that it doesn't conflict with existing lore or create any problems. If it does conflict, do not worry, the `Lore Keepers` will work with you to update either your new content or the existing content to resolve the conflict or concern.

### Contributing Ideas

Not sure how to create a Pull Request, don't have time to flesh the idea out or not sure how it should get fleshed out? No problem! You can create an issue or discussion and work on it in there with anyone else who is interested.
