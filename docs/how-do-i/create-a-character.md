# How to start a character

1. See the character creation guidelines (coming soon) for building a character.

2. Submit [a character issue](https://github.com/our-stories/west-marches/issues/new?assignees=&labels=character%2Cunapproved&template=character.md&title=Character%3A+NAME+OF+CHARACTER). A game master will work with you in the comments to sort out any character building questions and issues.

3. After that's is completed and approved, [create a wiki page](https://github.com/our-stories/west-marches/wiki/_new) with your character information.

You are welcome to create as many characters as you would like, but you can only choose a single character for each session. Most characters started out at level 3, but you are welcome to make a character of any level (no guarantees that there will be a spot for your level 20 when everyone else is level 5 though.) All officially published materials are allowed. 

If you are storing your character in dndbeyond.com, you are encouraged to join one of the campaigns for the game there where you will have access to all materials owned by the players (which should be basically everything). There will eventually be more than 1 campaign there as there is a limit of 12 players per campaign and we'll likely end up with more. You can ask in discord for an invite link to a campaign.
