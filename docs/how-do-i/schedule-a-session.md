# How to schedule a session

Each session will need to be scheduled. For every session, a player in the party should [begin a session issue](https://github.com/our-stories/west-marches/issues/new?assignees=&labels=session&template=session.md&title=Session%3A+SOMETHING+WITTY) filling out as many details as possible.

Each session can only have between 2-4 players (excluding the Game Master). Once the scheduling details are sorted out, the Game Master will offer a couple places for explorations. If this is the first time the characters have met each other, the party can use the issue comments to role play introductions. That way we can dive into the exploration early in the session.

If the party is scheduling a continuation from a previous session, include a link and details where the party left off. Continuations do not need the same party composition as long as 2/3rd of players from the previous session are okay with it continuing.

Expectations for a session:

* **Be 15 minutes early.** This helps the party start on time. It's also fun to break the ice. The game will go a lot smoother.
* **Video chat is required.** We will use audio **and** video for our session.

## After a session ends

After a session ends, every character that participated needs to submit a short recap of the session from their character's point of view. A few sentences will do.

Experience points (XP) will be awarded to all characters to track on their characters. Updates to the character's wiki are appreciated as it will help us for new sessions.
