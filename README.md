# D&D West Marches

Welcome to the home of our West Marches Dungeons and Dragons game!

[West Marches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGAC-gBoX9k) is a different take on traditional [Dungeon and Dragons (and RPGs in general)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons). Instead of a regular set of players that meet on a regular schedule, a subset of all the players and a Game Master (GM) will schedule sessions ad-hoc.

That way there is no commitment beyond a single session. If you enjoy yourself, and want to play again, join up again at a time that is convenient!

## House rules and expectations

In order to avoid any misunderstandings, these are the expectations for all people joining the game (both players and GMs).

1. **Be kind.** This is a game that we are playing for fun. Please don't be disrepectful towards others.
2. **Be patient.** Not every game will go smoothly. Please be patient with GMs and other players.
3. **Be on time.** It is difficult enough to schedule a session with people's lives. Accidents do happen, but please arrive on time and prepared.
4. **Have fun.** This game is about exploring imagination. Have fun with it.
5. **Share the spotlight.** It is easy to lose sight that this is a game of cooperation. Every character brings something unique to the party, and we should embrace and encourage that.

## Setting: Waldenstone

_This game takes place in a homebrew territory within [Exandria](https://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Exandria) from [Critical Role](https://critrole.com/)._

Welcome to Waldenstone. A mid-sized town surrounded by the ruthless Wilderness.

It's surprising that Waldenstone still survives. Luckily they are not fully cut off from the outside world by regular merchant wagons that tempt fate on the Main Road: the only road in and out of town and to the civilized world beyond.

You would think that being built near the Lucidean Ocean that more seafaring traffic would come in and out. However professional pirates and worse lurk the waters making it more treacherous than the hidden underwater caverns and formations ready to scuttle a ship. Or leave it helpless until the aforementioned threats have a chance.

The citizens of Waldenston are hardworking and stubborn. They have to be both to survive on their own as they do. Mostly focusing on farming, mining, and crafting for other locals, they have found a self-sustaining harmony with the menaces beyond the town's borders.

Magic users exist, if uncommon. Many clerics and wizards have setup shop to hawk their wares or be of service to the people. And of course magic users will travel through with their eyes on rare mystic reagents. Some known only to this region.

The Wilderness has begun stirring. And although the sensible townsfolk keep watch and lock their doors at night, that hasn't been enough. Merchants have taken word out beyond Waldenstone to share stories of creatures antagonising the peaceful folk, and their trade. Not that it's entirely altruistic. The safer the roads, the more merchants can bring their wares. And more money they can pocket.

**Will you step up in their time of need? Will you take advantage of the situation? Will you leave your mark on Waldenstone?**

### FAQ

* **What is the tone?** Of all the questions, this is the most important one. The **tone for this game is to have fun!** Fun doesn't not always mean silliness. It does not always mean stressful deadly situations. But it can mean both sometimes. The tone will need to be decided in every session because it's up to the party to decide. As a GM, I prefer to take this lighthearted to start with. We are here to have fun, so let's have fun. Seriousness will come in time, if it ever does.
* **What's the primary setting, location and adventure type?** This is set in a frontier town cut off from many external connections. The surrounding area is wild and ruthless.
* **How are the party members connected?** That's up to you dear Players! YOU decide who and why you are connected. In the beginning of each session, that will be something a GM asks the party to figure out in the issue before we meet.
* **What's magic like in the setting?** Magic is not unheard of. But it is not so common that a magical item is a treasured heirloom. Magic users do exist and setup shops and research facilities across the world. Waldenstone has fewer options...for now.
* **How old is the world?** Waldenstone lives in an ancient world. Many long lived races remember legendary civilizations that have long since perished. And yet, they have heard the myths of many more that have long been forgotten to even their forebears.
* **What is the scale of the game?** This is really open ended. The nature of a West Marches game does lend itself to be centered around Waldenstone. This is not a normal campaign that has the luxury to delve into nuanced areas...Yet. Perhaps it will change.
* **Is there some sort of chat I can join?** You betcha. I would prefer most permanent lore/session/character chatter end up here on GitHub. But for realtime chat, feel free to join us on [discord](https://discord.gg/m8fu5US).

## How to start a character

Start by submitting [a character issue](https://github.com/our-stories/west-marches/issues/new?assignees=&labels=character%2Cunapproved&template=character.md&title=Character%3A+NAME+OF+CHARACTER). A game master will work with you in the comments to sort out any character building questions and issues.

After that's is completed and approved, [create a wiki page](https://github.com/our-stories/west-marches/wiki/_new) with your character information.

You are welcome to create as many characters as you would like, but you can only choose a single character for each session.

## How to schedule a session

Each session will need to be scheduled. For every session, a player in the party should [begin a session issue](https://github.com/our-stories/west-marches/issues/new?assignees=&labels=session&template=session.md&title=Session%3A+SOMETHING+WITTY) filling out as many details as possible.

Each session can only have between 2-4 players (excluding the Game Master). Once the scheduling details are sorted out, the Game Master will offer a couple places for explorations. If this is the first time the characters have met each other, the party can use the issue comments to role play introductions. That way we can dive into the exploration early in the session.

If the party is scheduling a continuation from a previous session, include a link and details where the party left off. Continuations do not need the same party composition as long as 2/3rd of players from the previous session are okay with it continuing.

Expectations for a session:

* **Be 15 minutes early.** This helps the party start on time.
* **Video chat is required.** We will use audio **and** video for our session.
* **Sessions may be recorded.** The party will decide whether the session's recorded and will be public or private.

## After a session ends

After a session ends, every character that participated needs to submit a short recap of the session from their character's point of view. A few sentences will do.

Experience points (XP) will be awarded to all characters to track on their characters. Updates to the character's wiki are appreciated as it will help us for new sessions.

## I have thoughts that I would prefer to share anonymously

I totally get it. If you don't feel comfortable sharing opinions through issues, please submit it through [this anonymous online tool](http://freesuggestionbox.com/pub/hxezqqw).

I will periodically go through them and address important and/or common themes as they come up.

## I want to help!

I would love help! The more the players engage, the better the games will be!

There are many ways to contribute. You don't need to ask permission, just dive in.

* **World building:** cities, lore, races, legends, factions, big bad evil people. If you would like to help by creating any of these, submit an issue and we'll talk it over!
* **Exploration:** where will the party explore? Why? Who or what will they need to overcome?
* **Battlemaps:** sharing battlemaps, custom made or found are always welcome!
* **In game role playing:** perhaps you would like to RP as an NPC interating with the party? Or perhaps you would like to narrate the hits and misses. If this sounds like fun, let me know at the beginning of the session.
* **Expansive recaps:** writing up an expansive and egaging recap of the session helps everyone. You are also welcome to submit a recap _as an NPC._
* **Rules knowledge:** A Game Master's job is **not to remember all the rules.** Their job is merely to adjudicate. If anyone wants to help by doing the research in-game, they are welcome! Remember though, that the Game Master may still make a ruling on the fly in order to not get bogged down flipping pages.
* **GMing or Co-GMing:** If anyone wants to try their own hand at running a game, let a Game Master know! There are many ways to help even if you don't take on the full GM responsibility.

## FAQ

* **How do characters level up?** Characters need to take a full rest in order to level up. They do not need to be back in a town.
* **Why is video necessary?** Playing RPGs online can be tough over voice-only. It's tough to gauge when other people are ready to jump in. In addition, leaning on imagination can make folks feel self-conscious and sometime silly. Seeing other's reactions helps with comraderie.
* **Why are recordings?** The unpredictable nature of West Marches can make it harder to remember where the party left off. Also this game is welcoming to people new to RPGs, and watching the recordings help people understand what to expect. With multiple GMs, it's also helpful to share and review what happened in other sessions.
* **Can we have 2-3 of XYZ class in a party?** Hell yeah you can! I consider _balanced parties boring._ How cool would the story be with a party of wizards? Or bards? The party will need to adjust their strategies, but balanced parties are **not** a requirement. Or even encouraged.
