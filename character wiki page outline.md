## Backstory

_Your character wasn't born yesterday. Where did they come from? Have they raised themselves from the gutters as a child? Were they pampered among the highest royalty? Who the hell is your character?_

_Even though other players can read your character's background, their characters won't act on it unless it is shared with them in game._

## Potential Plot Hooks

_People are flawed. Not even you dear adventurer are perfect! Has your character pissed someone off? Are they outlawed from a certain town for a... misunderstanding? Do they struggle to overcome something: a paranoia, a physical limitation, an addiction?_ 

_This is entirely optional, but depending on the flare the approving GM may award an XP bonus while your character struggles with their demons._
