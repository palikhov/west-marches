# Character creation guidelines

## Character level
You can create a character at any level, but it is at the GMs discretion to run games for the character levels they feel comfortable with.
General guideline is to create a character between levels 1 and 3.

## Restrictions
There aren't hard and fast restrictions for character creation. Generally speaking, all official source books are allowed.

## Ability scores
Guideline is to use point buy, or to roll ability scores using 4d6, drop lowest 6 times. If total ability mod is less than 2, the player may choose to reroll all scores. Rolling can be done publicly in the Discord server's rolls channel, or on the honor system.

## Step-by-step characters
This is intended to help guide character creation for a PC in a long-running campaign. The player should use “Step By Step Characters” on pg. 11 of the Player’s Handbook to come up with a general character concept (race, class, one sentence backstory at minimum) and then put that concept through the following checklist, considering each bullet point carefully and modifying the character concept accordingly. Once step 1-5 are completed, the character concept should be presented in a session 0 where the concept will be work-shopped by the DM/party members.
*Note: It is ok for your character concept to morph once you begin to get a feel for them during actual gameplay. By following this checklist, you ensure that your character concept will at least survive first contact with the game itself and the rest of the party while not being too shallow or too over-developed to break the immersion of your gaming group.

**1. Choose a Race**
- Ask the DM how the race fits into the world (and if it does), along with social standing, how they are perceived by commoners, etc.
- Does my race fit the tone/alignment/setting of the campaign? (E.G. how would normal villagers react to my race?) The race selection should provide a backdrop to the character’s place in the world but should not be the defining characteristics of the character.

**2. Choose a Class and Proficiencies**
- What niche or niches in the party is my character trying to fill? (E.G. Tank, Healer, Ranged DPS, Melee DPS, Controller, Face, Etc.)
- How does my character interact with the three pillars of gameplay? Ask yourself what interests your character with regards to:
- Exploration (E.G. Interested in magical artifacts and loves to discover who made them 		and how they work)
- Social (E.G. Likes using intellect over charm in most social situations and can be stand-offish)
-Combat (E.G. Generally uses spells to assist the party without doing direct damage)
Based on what you said above, pencil in some skill proficiencies/class 		features/languages/or tool proficiencies that assist those interactions and support the 		character concept.
- Do my character’s chosen proficiencies match my character concept/backstory?

**3. Determine Ability Scores**
- Do my character’s attributes align with my perception of the character? (E.G. I picture my character as instantly likeable but my charisma modifier is negative which makes my vision of the character incongruous with the game's mechanics)
- Are my attributes allocated efficiently enough to contribute to the party’s success? (E.G. Did I dump intellect because I want to RP a dumb wizard? If so, wouldn't an Arcane Knight fit that character concept while still being a useful member of the party?)

**4. Describe Your Character (Alignment/Characteristics)**
- Does my character fit the tone and alignment of the world/campaign?
- A character’s Personality Traits should add flavor to the character and tell-by-showing things about that character such as personality/quirks/upbringing/profession/etc. Personality Traits are the characteristics that are most likely to change over the course of an adventure.
- A character’s Ideals represent their closely held beliefs and describe how the character believes they themselves are as well as how the world should be. It should affect how a character acts on a day-to-day basis. On adventures it is likely that their Ideals will be threatened either in the world or inside themselves, causing an emotional reaction (anger, guilt, sadness) from the character.
Ask yourself “Do my character’s Ideals match their alignment?”

- A character’s Bond should describe something that they value over everything else. A character should prioritize fulfilling their Bond over any other decision. Ask yourself “does my character’s Bond fit the tone of the world/campaign and give the DM an interesting hook to use to motivate them to take action?” (E.G. a character whose Bond is "Everything I do is for the common people" should prioritize thwarting a Gnoll attack on a group of refugees over finishing the parties’ quest to escort a rich merchant’s caravan)
- A characters Flaw should be something that motivates the player to act against their own best interests. Ideally, the flaw will be fun and add flavor to the character without being distracting or annoying to the other players or the DM. (E.G. Overconfidence, Spends too much money, Easily Angered, etc.) Ask yourself “Is my character’s Flaw fun without being annoying or disruptive to the DM or my fellow party members?”
- Imagine your Personality Traits, Ideals, Bond, and Flaws and then imagine how your character would react in mundane situations such as:
- buying items in a market
- being cheated by a merchant
- being fired from a job
- going to a healer for treatment, etc.

**4a. Backstory**
A character’s backstory should be a brief story that informs the characters personality, upbringing, connections, skill sets, past jobs, personality traits, and what caused them to seek the life of an adventurer. A backstory is NOT a ten page story about the character’s past exploits. A good backstory should include the bare minimum information that set a character to adventuring while not containing events that are more monumental than a first level character will experience in-game. Ask yourself the following questions:
- What is my character's reason for becoming an adventurer?
- What would my character do if they achieved the goal that set them to adventuring? Would they continue to adventure or retire?
- Is my character’s backstory in-line with their starting level/tier of play? (E.G. playing a famous warlord who overthrew an empire does not make sense for the backstory for a 1st level character)
-Is there room for my character to grow and develop over the course of the upcoming adventure or did I accidentally create a fully-formed static character?
- Is my character concept one-note or a "joke" character that does not allow for meaningful interaction with the three pillars of gameplay?

**5. Choose Equipment**
- Does my equipment fit my proficiencies?
- Does my equipment fit my backstory/concept?
- Does my equipment let me meaningfully interact with the three pillars of gameplay?
- Is my equipment flavored to fit my character concept? (E.G. reflavoring a longsword as a katana for a samurai character)

**6. Come Together**
While you should take this step into consideration when creating your character concept by communicating with your fellow players, this step is meant to be completed in session 0 with the rest of the party and DM present. To have a defined role in (and to play nicely with) the party, ask yourself the following questions:
- What is my unique niche in the party and can I fulfill it satisfactorily? (tank, melee dps, ranged dps, healer, controller, persuader, investigator, sneaky guy, etc.)
- Do my skill/tool/language proficiencies compliment the other party members’ proficiencies?
- My character does not completely overshadow or is completely overshadowed by another party member at my chosen niches?
- Does my character fit the tone and alignment of the party? (E.G. A lawful neutral paladin in a chaotic evil party will cause the campaign to fail quickly)
- My character concept is not annoying or disruptive to other players? (E.G. an overtly sexual thief who steals from party members will probably be annoying and abrasive.)
- Will my character and their backstory peacefully coexist with everyone else in the party?
- Does my character have fun and interesting chemistry with at least one other party member from the get-go? (E.G. A young naive monk who sees herself as an apprentice/life-coach to the old crusty thief who is constantly annoyed by the young monk but feels protective of her in a grandfatherly way)

**7. Final Check**
- Do the pros of adventuring with my character outweigh the cons?
- Will this character be fun to spend time developing for 6 months?
- Will this character be fun to play in all three pillars of gameplay for 6 months?
