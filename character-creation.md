# Character creation guidelines

## Character level
You can create a character at any level, but it is at the GMs discretion to run games for the character levels they feel comfortable with.
General guideline is to create a character between levels 1 and 3.

## Restrictions
There aren't hard and fast restrictions for character creation. Generally speaking, all official source books are allowed.

## Ability scores
Guideline is to use point buy, or to roll ability scores using 4d6, drop lowest 6 times. If total ability mod is less than 2, the player may choose to reroll all scores. Rolling can be done publicly in the Discord server's rolls channel, or on the honor system.
