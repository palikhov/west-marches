# Character creation guidelines

## Character sheets
Character sheets are hosted on [DnD Beyond](www.dndbeyond.com)
The character sheets here do not require background or appearance information, as that information should be found on the character's Wiki page. (See [character wiki page outline](character%20wiki%20page%20outline.md).)

## Character level
You can create a character at any level, but it is at the GMs discretion to run games for the character levels they feel comfortable with.
General guideline is to create a character between levels 1 and 3 or at a level that roughly matches other character's levels you wish to play with.

## Restrictions
There aren't hard and fast restrictions for character creation. Generally speaking, all official source books are allowed.

## Ability scores
Guideline is to use point buy, or to roll ability scores using 4d6, drop lowest 6 times. If total ability mod is less than +2, the player may choose to reroll all scores. Rolling can be done publicly in the Discord server's rolls channel, or on the honor system.
